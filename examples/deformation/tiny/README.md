deformation.yaml
================

This model includes most of the potential structural complexity of a 
deformation GGXF file.  It includes

* multiple deformation elements (GGXF groups)
* nested grids (minimally)
* different parameters in different groups
* time functions with multiple base functions

It is not a realistic deformation model.  The deformation it represents is not continuous and the deformation field it defines is meaningless.  It does not include uncertainty parameters or other potential features of a deformation model.  

It is provided to test the viability of encoding the deformation model in GGXF, not to test the deformation model specifications.
